### Your program should:

- Compare the two unused lowest elements in each of the subarrays as a pair
- Copy the first of the two values to the resulting array based on standard ASCII/UTF-8 sort order
- Repeat steps 1 and 2 until one of the arrays is empty
- Finally copy remaining data in the non-empty subarray to the resulting array

### Input:

Two comman-separated, sorted arrays of alphanumeric characters (UTF-8). The pair of arrays are separated by a semicolon.

For example: 1,4,7,8;2,3,5,6
